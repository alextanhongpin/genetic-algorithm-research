    "1. It begins by creating the genetic algorithm's initial population. \n",
    "2. This population is then evaluated to find the fitness values of its individuals.\n",
    "3. Next, a check is run to decide if the genetic algorithm begins looping and the population goes through its first round of crossover and mutation before finally being reevaluated.\n",
    "4. From here, *crossover* and *mutation* are continuously applied until the termination condition is met, and the genetic algorithm terminates.\n"
